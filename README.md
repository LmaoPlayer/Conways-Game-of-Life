# Conway's Game of Life

> ## What is Conway's Game of Life?
>
> ### It's a simulation of cells with a few rules:
> 1. A cell can *spawn* with 3 living cells surrounding it.
> 2. A cell *stays alive* when there are 2 or 3 living cells around it.
> 3. A cell *dies* when there less than 2 cells alive around it or when there are more than 3 alive around it.

> ## Controls:
> 
> - A Start button to start the simulation
> - A Stop button to stop the simulation, this only appears when start is clicked.
> - A speed up button to let the simulation run nearly double as fast.
> - A slow down button to let the simulation run slower, just like the stop button, this only appears when speed up is clicked.
> - A Reset button to clear out the field. This also will stop the simulation if it is running.
> - Clicking the field will draw or delete the cell you've clicked on.
>
> ## A few extras:
>
> - You can add extra shapes can be added by inserting files in ConwaysGameOfLifeButInAPictureBox\bin\Debug
> These files however need to end with .txt, all that comes infront of it don't matter.
>> For a quick example of files, you can find them at https://conwaylife.com/wiki, click on the links in the top right corner of the Wiki, select a shape you wish for, open the "Pattern files" on the sidebar and download the Plaintext.
